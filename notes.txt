Algorithm steps
for each resample time indexed by k - starts at 0
    
    Would be distributed:
    for each ensemble member j
        if k >0
            if j \in cut_index_array
                # Question: Will we ever be in a situation where trajectory j is overwritten (replaced by another)
                # but another ensemble member is assigned to be a replaced by a clone of j and no longer has access to it.
                read the trajectory indexed by `replaced[j]` from t=0 to t_{k}
                write to your allocated spot, replacing your own
            end
            add noise to the solution at t_k 
        end

        integrate member j from t_{k-1} to t_k, starting from u_{k-1}
        store in allocated spot in shared array (DistributedArrays.jl)
        compute score using u_{k-1} to u_k (smaller D array?)
    end
    
    Centralized tasks:
    1. Obtain scores from all members, compute normalization = mean. z[k] = norm # Score = e^(c*integral)
    2. Compute weight_j = score_j/norm for all j # Normal array of length n_ensemble # # Weights are normalized to sum to N
    3. Compute n_copies_j for all j  # Normal array of length n_ensemble # Sum(n_copies) could be > n_ensemble or < n_ensemble
    4. Determine which ensemble members are cut, make a cut_index array.
    5. For each cut trajectory, roll many sided die with probabilities per side based on n_copies (or weights??)
    5. Create replaced_index array that is the same size as cut_index?
    

end


1a. decide which trajectories gets cut based on score (those with n_copies = 0)
1b. Make a cut_index array (when we loop over the ensemble, ask if ensemble member index is in the cut index array?)
2. generate a random array of indices of remaining trajectories (based on n_copies[n_copies !=0])
    This represents the many sided dice with different probabiilties for different sides.
    E.g. if 1 has 3 copies, and 6 has 2 copies, we would haev [1,1,1,6,6]
3. When we loop over ensemble members, if the traj is in the cut_index array, sample from [1,1,1,6,6] at random *or*
    sample from [1,6] with probability [3/5, 2/5].



1 1 1 1 1 cut

# Rewrite first file of  ensemble 1
2 2 2 2 2  | 2' 2' 2' 2' 2'
2 2 2 2 2  | 2  2  2  2  2

# Dont rewrite but append and reconstruct later
1 1 1 1 1  | 2' 2' 2' 2' 2' # this was replaced by 2
2 2 2 2 2  | 2  2  2  2  2

# Delete and reconstruct later
2' 2' 2' 2' 2' # this was replaced by 2
2 2 2 2 2  | 2  2  2  2  2

# after each round you have an array of nodes
ensemble_nodes = [n21, n22, n23]

# init step
ensemble_nodes = [Node(first_file, nothing), etc...]

# updating step 
ensemble_nodes = [n21, n22, Node(new_file, n22)]

# reconstruct
for node in ensemble_nodes
    values = []
    while node.parent
        value = node.value
        push!(values, value)
        node = node.parent
    end
    make_trajectory(values)
